  <h2>About the Project</h2>

  <p><strong>Labour and Work in Ghana, 1951–2010</strong></p>

  <p>
    This international research project brings together scholars from Ghana, the United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden to investigate the history of labour and work in Ghana from the early post-colonial period to the early 21st century. It is funded jointly by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) and the German Research Foundation (DFG).
  </p>

  <p>
    The project examines long-term changes in labour relations, employment structures, and everyday work in Ghana between 1951 and 2010. It responds to two key trends in labour history: first, the increasing focus on informal, precarious, and non-wage forms of work; and second, evidence that wage labour—especially in rural areas—has often been underestimated. These insights challenge earlier assumptions that post-colonial African labour markets would evolve along European-style proletarian models.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a rich combination of sources—including interviews, surveys, censuses, archival records, newspapers, and court documents—the project develops a national overview and focuses in detail on case studies in southern and western cocoa-growing regions, and northern areas to capture different aspects of labour experiences in the rice sector. Research questions address shifts in workforce composition, employment forms, earnings, migration, regional inequalities, and the relationship between poverty, informality, and work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project team includes historians and social scientists from the University of Cambridge, Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Ghana, and University of Cape Coast, working collaboratively to produce new insights into Ghana’s labour history and broader post-colonial labour dynamics.
